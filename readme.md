# Improving Accessibility with HTML CSS and Git
================

## Description

In this project, the goal was to improve the accessibility of this webpage. In order to do this, I had to refactor the code by replacing nav tags with semantic elements and including alt tags in images. I also reorganized the CSS and consolidated the source code.

## Finished Product 

This image is the finished product that displays the appearance of the Horiseon website after code refactor. The refactor didn't affect the appearance of the site:
